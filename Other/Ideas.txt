	When having a stupid fast battle with someone else, their will be slowdown quick time events for each fighter. These slowdowns will look like slowdowns to the fighters BUT to onlookers, it will do that thing in anime where they just disapear/shadow step thing/turn into fast moving streaks of lines, for a second. Sortof like a way cooler version of a big cloud of smoke they used to do in old cartoons.

	wouldn't it be cool if you could clone/make a fake windows monitor and render it in a game? Metaverse eat ur heart out.
